# developer-notes

{{ cookiecutter.module_name }} is a pre-commit enabled. When pre-commit is installed, the developers git commits will be guarded by various pre-commit checks. These check ensure that your local changes are linted prior to running Github Action workflows remotely.

## Recommendations

We strongly recommend you manage `terraform` with [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv). This workspace leverages the [.terraform-version](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv#terraform-version-file) used by `tfenv`.

## Usage

Use `make` to initialize and install pre-commit.

## Test

Test terraform examples with [Terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/).

```bash
$ make test
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test test/terraform_basic_test.go
ok  	command-line-arguments	10.757s
go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test test/terraform_complete_test.go
ok  	command-line-arguments	7.832s
```

## Doc generation

Code formatting and documentation for variables and outputs is generated using [pre-commit-terraform hooks](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform) which uses [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs).

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform#how-to-install) to install pre-commit locally.

And install `terraform-docs` with `go get github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs` or `brew install terraform-docs`.
